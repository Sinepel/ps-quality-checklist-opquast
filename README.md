# Prestashop Quality Checklist Opquast

Accessibility, referencing, performance, navigation, mobile, video, security... good web practices gathered in the reference checklist for web professionals!

This Prestashop extension allows you to obtain the 240 criteria of Opquast's Web Quality checklist in your Prestashop back-office.

You can tick the compliant, non-compliant or non-applicable criteria of your shop and thus get a complete view of the level of compliance of your site with Opquast's web quality criteria.

This extension was created by [Constantin Boulanger](https://www.constantin-boulanger.fr), technical director of the [MDWeb](https://www.mdweb.fr) agency, with the participation of Ã‰lie Sloim, president and founder of [Opquast](https://www.opquast.com/) and via the original idea of [Jb Audras](https://jeanbaptisteaudras.com/) who created the [WordPress version](https://fr.wordpress.org/plugins/quality-checklist-opquast/) of this checklist.
